The Bitmazk Environment
=======================

This repository holds a script ``initvbox.sh`` that will install all the awesome 
tools we use to build awesome webapps at bitmazk. It should help new developers
to setup their machines or virtual boxes easily and get up to speed in no time.

From time to time we might also add some configs like ``.gitconfig`` that have
proven to be good settings for our everyday tools.

This script should run without problems on Ubuntu 10.10
